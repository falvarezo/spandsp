This directory should contain a file name mitel-cm7291-talkoff.wav, which
is a transcription of the talk-off test section of the Mitel DTMF test tape
(i.e. side two of the original cassette tape). Since it is copyright
material it cannot be included.

Note that the DTMF tests in the test directory fully emulate all the tests
on the first side of the Mitel test tape, by synthesising the signals from
scratch.
