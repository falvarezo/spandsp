The files in this directory contain transcriptions of the BellCore DTMF test
tapes, digitised at 8000 samples per second, using 16 bit signed samples.
They were transcribed from a brand new copy of the tapes, using a speed
adjustable cassette player. The test tone at the start of the tapes is
pretty accurate, and the new tapes should not have had much opportunity to
stretch. I believe these transcriptions are about as good as the source
material permits.

PLEASE NOTE
-----------
These transcriptions may be freely used by anyone who has a legitimate
copy of the original tapes. However, if you don't have a legitimate copy of
those tapes, you also have no right to use this data. The original tapes are
the copyright material of BellCore, and they charge over US$200 for a set. I
doubt they sell enough copies to consider this much of a business. However, it
is their data, and it is their right to do as they wish with it. Currently I
see no indication they wish to give it away for free.
